A current work in progress:

Project to web scrape job listings online and return the most suitable positions based on a user-inputted resume.

Uses sklearn's implementation of cosine similarity to match the most suitable job listings based on imported user resume and web scraped job listings.

User resume data is extracted using PymuPDF.

Integrated using Flask to produce a web interface.
